The language I  have made this algorithm is C# and editor Visual Studio. It is a windows console application.

The exercise:
You need to build a simple scheduler application. It will read a config file (xml,
json, etc) that has a list of tasks and each task a list of schedules. Schedules can be
daily, weekly or monthly and can be repeated (for example daily and repeat every
1 hour).
1. Design an object model to represent the necessary entities
2. Implement the scheduler to start each task at the requested time
It's imperative that the task is started at the exact time it's requested. Also take
into account cases when a task is still running when it should start again.

Be careful: If you have any error in your program than the problem is the file path because it is an absolute file path, we can make also this relative, for relative path see:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9042861/how-to-make-an-absolute-path-relative-to-a-particular-folder. Also code to be shortly we can make a method and pass argument in it and at cases we call the method. I dont think if you have any error that problem will be from TaskScheduler.dll, I have installed it from Package Manager Console: PM>Install-Package TaskScheduler -Version 2.8.15
