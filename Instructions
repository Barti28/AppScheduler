The language I  have made this algorithm is C# and editor Visual Studio. It is a windows console application.

The exercise:
You need to build a simple scheduler application. It will read a config file (xml,
json, etc) that has a list of tasks and each task a list of schedules. Schedules can be
daily, weekly or monthly and can be repeated (for example daily and repeat every
1 hour).
1. Design an object model to represent the necessary entities
2. Implement the scheduler to start each task at the requested time
It's imperative that the task is started at the exact time it's requested. Also take
into account cases when a task is still running when it should start again.
